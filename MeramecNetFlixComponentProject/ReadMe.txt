Step 1: When you are done creating and testing all your custom business objects, CRUD objects and other classes that you want to be in your
custom Component Libary, copy or add all classes to the MeramecNetFlixComponent Project.

Step 2: Make sure all classes that were copied into the component library have MeramecNetFlixComponentLibrary as the
namespace

Step 3: Do a Build and Compile to save the dll. The dll will be called MeramecNetFlixComponentLibrary and it will be 
saved either to the Debug or Release Folder depending on the BuildManager settings.

Step 4: You will have to add the MeramecNetFlixComponentLibrary.dll as a reference to the MeramecNetFlixProject.
Read the rojectFileReadMe.txt file inside the MeramecNetFlixProject project.
